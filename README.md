# imagizer2
Small lightweight application to convert an entire folder of files from one format to another, resize them, and/or strip EXIF data.

Very basic, but it is multi-threaded, and only relies on .NET v2.0 so should run on just about anything, and quite useful!

I was tired of all the terrible options available online, especially with most of them wanting money
just to be able to batch convert a folder full of images, so I made this app. Hopefully someone else
also finds this app useful to them.
