Thanks for looking at Imagizer2. This is the first public release of this project even though the project was
always intended to be open source from the get go. 

Why Imagizer2?
Well I first created Imagizer around 2004-5 in VB.NET as back then I was only a VB programmer. Infact this
was one of my first .NET apps.I have since learned a lot more about .net and have also learned C#. I
decided to re-write the app in C# and that is also when I added multi threading capability.

I was tired of all the terrible options available online, especially with most of them wanting money
just to be able to batch convert a folder full of images, so I made this app. Hopefully someone else
also finds this app useful to them.

NOTE: To build this project you shouldn't need anything other than Visual Studio 2008 installed. The 
project could be converted to work in Visual Studio 2005 as well.

NOTE2: As of 2016 I am now using Visual Studio 2015 -- but it isnt really using any of the specific
features of 2015 -- so I am sure you could get the project to open in later versions. There are multiple
(current) free versions of Visual Studio availiableon Microsoft's website -- I would suggest grabbing
one if you don't have it currently.
