Thanks for looking at Imagizer2.

Why Imagizer2?
Well I first created Imagizer around 2004-5 in VB.NET as back then I was only a VB programmer. Infact this
was one of my first .NET apps.I have since learned a lot more about .NET and have also learned C#. I
decided to re-write the app in C# and that is also when I added multi threading capability.

I was tired of all the terrible options available online, especially with most of them wanting money
just to be able to batch convert a folder full of images, so I made this app. Hopefully someone else
also finds this app useful to them.

NOTE: To build this project you shouldn't need anything other than Visual Studio 2008 installed. The 
project could be converted to work in Visual Studio 2005 as well.

NOTE2: As of 2016 I am now using Visual Studio 2015 -- but it isn't really using any of the specific
features of 2015 -- so I am sure you could get the project to open in prior versions. There are multiple
(current) free versions of Visual Studio available  on Microsoft's website -- I would suggest grabbing
one if you don't have it currently.

NOTE: Install https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=26829 for CR2 support -- NOT IMPLEMENTED YET
